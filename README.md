Always Optimized Agents: The Path to Self-Improving AI Agents

At SparkBeyond, we believe that operational AI agents in general, and customer-facing AI agents in particular, should improve over time even effectively. 

Operational agents are designed and built with a KPIs at mind. To optimize an agent, whether it’s a sales agent optimizing conversion rates and order values, or a support agent reducing resolution times, we systematically apply the cycle:  

Evaluate → Analyze → Improve → Simulate

That is, we measure the KPIs for  the current behavior of the agent, analyze what is driving each KPI up or down, and then propose decisions and actions to improve each KPI. The improved agent is then tested using a customer simulation. Once tested and deployed, we restart the cycle with the agent's new operational data!
