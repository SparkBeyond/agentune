**Open-source framework for continuously improving AI agents.**


Agentune helps teams **analyze, improve, and evaluate** customer-facing AI agents through measurable, data-driven iterations — not guesswork.


Instead of tweaking prompts and hoping for the best, Agentune connects **real conversations**, **context data**, and **simulations** into a repeatable optimization loop that drives actual KPI improvements such as conversion, CSAT, and retention.

## Why Agentune


Most agents are launched and left to stagnate — tuned by intuition, not evidence.


Agentune enables **continuous agent improvement** by combining analytics, optimization, and simulation in a single open framework:


- **Analyze** – uncover what drives your agent’s KPIs up or down  
- **Improve** – generate actionable recommendations to lift performance  
- **Simulate** – safely test and benchmark improvements before deployment  


The result: agents that don’t just respond — they **learn what works**.


---


## Modules


Agentune consists of modular components designed to work together or standalone:


### 🧠 [Agentune Analyze & Improve](agentune_analyze/README.md)
Turn real transcripts and telemetry into insights and recommended actions that measurably improve agent KPIs.


### 🧪 [Agentune Simulate](agentune_simulate/README.md)
Create customer simulations to test and benchmark your agent's behavior before production.


Together, these modules form the **Analyze → Improve → Simulate** loop — a disciplined framework for building smarter, higher-performing AI agents.


---


## Quickstart


Agentune is modular. Each package includes its own quickstart guide:


- [**Analyze & Improve**](agentune_analyze/README.md) — extract insights from real data and generate improvement recommendations.
- [**Simulate**](agentune_simulate/README.md) — validate agent behavior and benchmark changes before deployment.  


---


## Real-World Use Cases


Agentune is built for teams who want to move beyond trial-and-error:


- **AI platform / infra teams** managing production-grade agents across multiple domains or use cases  
- **ML / data teams** accountable for KPI impact, not just model accuracy  
- **Product / ops teams** who need to measure and harden conversational behavior before it reaches users  


Common scenarios:
- Diagnose why conversion or CSAT is dropping  
- Quantify which behaviors, intents, or flows impact KPIs  
- Test new prompt or policy versions safely  
- Continuously improve deployed agents over time  


---


## Roadmap


**Current focus:** advancing **Analyze & Improve** with structured, context-aware optimization.


Planned milestones:
- Context-aware **feature generation and insight discovery**  
- Integration of **context features** into the **recommendation layer** for targeted improvement actions  
- Expanded evaluation and visualization tooling for Analyze & Improve results  


**Longer-term:**
- Multi KPI analytics: understand how improving one KPI impacts other KPIs and account for that in the suggested improvement recommendations.
- Optional multi-agent analytics and cross-agent benchmarking
