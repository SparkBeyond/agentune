            "content": "Absolutely—let me hit those three points for you:\n\n1) ANC vs. Sony XM3\n   • The XM3’s cancellation tops out around 32-35 dB.  H1H’s hybrid ANC hits ~40 dB and uses a second internal feedback mic, so low-rumble engines and HVAC hum get sliced a bit further.  In real-world travel tests it comes within 1-2 dB of Sony on airplanes, but does noticeably better with mid-frequency chatter in cafés and airports.  You still get a ‘transparency’ mode if you need to hear announcements.\n\n2) Mic quality\n   • Five-mic beam-forming array with cVc noise-suppression.  In-game comms stay clear and Zoom or Teams pick it up like a dedicated USB mic.  Most customers ditch their boom mic, but if you ever want one the 3.5 mm jack supports any detachable gaming boom for an extra layer of isolation.\n\n3) Price after discount\n   • Standard bundle (headphones + hardshell case + USB-C low-latency dongle) is $299.\n   • I can give you our best insider code:  VIP55SLN  →  $55 off orders $200+.\n   • That drops your total to $244  (free U.S. shipping + 30-day returns).  Code’s live for the next 24 hours.\n\nLet me know if those answers check all the boxes—or if you want me to lock that code to your email so it’s easy to apply at checkout.
