If your Samsung QN90A screen won't turn on, please try the following troubleshooting steps:\n\n1. **Check Power Source**: Make sure the TV is plugged in properly and that the power outlet is working. You can test this by plugging another device into the outlet.\n\n2. **Remote Control**: Ensure that the remote control is working and that the batteries are not dead. Try using the physical power button on the TV itself.\n\n3. **Unplug and Replug**: Disconnect the TV from the power source for about 60 seconds, then plug it back in and try turning it on again.\n\n4. **Check for Standby Light**: Look for a standby indicator light on the TV. If it's on, that means the TV is receiving power.\n\n5. **Reset**: If the TV responds but still won\u2019t turn on, consider performing a soft reset by holding the power button on the TV for about 10-15 seconds.\n\nIf these steps do not resolve the issue, it may require professional service. Let me know how it goes!"
