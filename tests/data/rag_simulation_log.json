Since you've already tried unplugging it, here are a few more troubleshooting steps you can try:\n\n1. **Check the Power Outlet**: Make sure the power outlet is working by plugging in a different device.\n\n2. **Inspect the Power Cable**: Look for any visible damage to the power cable. If it's damaged, it may need to be replaced.\n\n3. **Use the Remote**: Try turning on the TV using the remote control. If it doesn't respond, check if the remote has working batteries.\n\n4. **Power Button**: If available, try turning it on using the physical power button located on the TV itself.\n\n5. **Reset the TV**: If the TV seems to be receiving power (you see a standby light) but won't turn on, try holding the power button for 10-15 seconds to force a reset.\n\nIf none of these steps work, it may be best to contact Samsung support or a technician for further assistance. Let me know how it goes!"
