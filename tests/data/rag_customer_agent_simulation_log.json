Let's try a couple of more troubleshooting steps:\n\n1. **Check the Connections**: Ensure all cables, including HDMI and power cables, are securely connected.\n\n2. **Adjust Picture Settings**: Go to the TV's picture settings and try reducing the backlight or turning off features like Motion Smoothing, which sometimes can cause flickering.\n\n3. **Update Firmware**: Make sure your TV's firmware is up to date. You can usually check this in the settings menu.\n\n4. **Try a Different Input**: If you're using a specific device (like a DVD player or gaming console), switch to a different input source to see if the flickering persists.\n\nPlease let me know if any of these steps help!"
