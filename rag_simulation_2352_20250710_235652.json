The Hybrid is the firmest option (8/10), while Premium is medium-firm (7/10), and Classic is medium (6.5/10).\n\nIf you want maximum support and cooling, the Hybrid and Premium are top choices—Hybrid is firmer and bouncier, Premium is slightly softer with a plush feel.

For hot sleepers with back pain, both the Premium and Hybrid are excellent choices, but there are a few key differences:\n\n- The Hybrid is our firmest mattress (8/10 firmness) with individually wrapped springs for strong support and enhanced airflow—this helps with both back support and cooling. Many customers with back pain find the firmer Hybrid especially helpful for spinal alignment.\n- The Premium is slightly softer (7/10 firmness) with advanced foam layers that still offer excellent support but feel a bit more plush. Its breathable top layer helps with temperature regulation, but the Hybrid is usually a bit cooler due to the airflow from the springs.\n\nIf you prefer a firmer, more supportive feel (especially for back pain and staying cool), I’d recommend the Hybrid.

Here’s a quick overview of our main mattresses:\n\n- **Premium:** 27 cm thick, medium-firm (7/10), multiple comfort layers including visco gel for temperature regulation, and a charcoal-infused antibacterial visco layer for hygiene. It’s designed for both support and plush comfort, especially good for side sleepers who need pressure relief and spinal alignment.\n\n- **Hybrid:** 28 cm, firmer feel (8/10), combines pocket springs and memory foam for strong support with some contouring. Best suited for those who prefer a firmer sleep surface, like back or stomach sleepers (or if you want minimal sink-in).\n\n- **Classic:** 25 cm, softer (6/10), features a removable, washable cover and a pressure-relieving support core. This one has more ‘hug’ and is easiest to maintain, great if you like a softer feel and easy cleaning.\n\n**For a side sleeper who likes medium-firm:** I’d recommend the Premium—it offers the right balance between contouring comfort and support to cushion your shoulders and hips while keeping your spine aligned. If you want an even softer feel, the Classic is an option, but the Premium will likely suit you best for that middle ground.\n\nIf you share your preferred mattress size, I can also give you the exact discounted prices and check availability! 😊",

The Premium uses advanced foam layers for a plush yet supportive feel, great for those who want a slightly cushier surface. The Hybrid combines these foams with individually wrapped springs, which give a bit more bounce, targeted support (especially good for couples or those with back issues), and even greater airflow for temperature regulation. Both are available in medium-firm, so it really comes down to whether you prefer the classic memory foam feel (Premium) or the added spring support and breathability (Hybrid).\n\nWe absolutely offer a 100-night trial period—if the mattress isn’t a good fit, you can return or exchange it, no questions asked.
