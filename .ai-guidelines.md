# AI Assistant Guidelines

This file provides concise development guidelines for AI assistants working on this project.

## Code Standards
- **Python 3.12+** required - use modern features without backward compatibility concerns
- **PEP 8** with 100-character line limit
- Use **comprehensions** over loops when possible
- Tools: `ruff` (linting), `mypy` (type checking), `pytest` (testing), `poetry` (dependencies)

## Workflow
1. **Plan first** - propose implementation steps, wait for confirmation
2. **Implement** with docstrings for all public functions/classes
3. **Test** - run `pytest` after changes, fix failures before proceeding
4. **Document** - update relevant docs for significant changes

## Architecture
- **Modular design** - single responsibility per module
- **Clear APIs** - explicit interfaces between components
- **No circular imports**

## Example Flow
```
User: "Add JSON export feature"
Agent: "I'll implement this by: 1) Adding to_json() methods 2) Creating export function 3) Adding tests 4) Updating docs. Proceed?"
User: "Yes"
Agent: [implements → runs tests → updates docs]
```
