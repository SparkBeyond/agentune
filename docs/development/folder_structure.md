## Key Components

### `from agentune.simulate./` - Main Package
- **`models/`** - Core data structures (Message, Conversation, Intent, Outcome, etc.)
- **`participants/`** - Customer and agent implementations with abstract base classes
- **`runners/`** - Simulation execution engines (full simulation, hybrid modes)
- **`outcome_detection/`** - Conversation outcome detection
- **`channels/`** - Communication channel abstractions (placeholder interfaces)

### `tests/` - Testing
- Unit tests for all components
- **`fixtures/`** - Sample conversation data for testing

### `docs/` - Documentation  
- **`development/`** - Technical documentation, design decisions, and guidelines
```

## Architecture Principles

- **Modular Design**: Clear separation between data models, behavior, and orchestration
- **Abstract Base Classes**: Interface definitions in `base.py` files with concrete implementations
